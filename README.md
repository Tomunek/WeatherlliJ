# WeatherlliJ

Weather plugin for IntelliJ IDEA IDE.  
University project!  
It is common knowledge that programmers, and especially IT students don't leave their basements more than a few times a
year.
This plugin allows them to know the weather to more easily imagine what the outside world looks like.

This project uses free Open-Meteo weather API: https://open-meteo.com/.
