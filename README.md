# WeatherlliJ
Weather plugin for IntelliJ IDEA IDE.  
University project!  
It is common knowledge that programmers, and especially IT students don't leave their basements more than a few times a year. 
This plugin allows them to know the weather to more easily imagine what the outside world looks like.
